# MULTOVL in a Singularity container

By convention the Singularity recipes have a `.def` extension,
and the image files `.sif`. The latter are `.gitignore`-d.

For experiments you can use Singularity sandboxes under the `sandboxes`
subdirectory. This contains a `.gitignore` file to put it under source control.
